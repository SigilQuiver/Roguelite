# Roguelite
you need pygame v2.0.0 at the very least, run main.py for the game

use "py -m pip install pygame" in the cmd to install pygame

use WSAD to control the player, TAB to enlarge the map and the mouse to shoot

if you press P an image of the game will be saved to "gamedir/output", but if that folder is not present, no image will be saved
